- 👋 Hi, I’m @skeletonkey. A bit about me: Go, Perl, Bash, and all-around polyglot. Trying to find the right language for the task at hand. Leader of nerds and a perpetual student.
- 👀 Automating mundane tasks so I can return to what I enjoy!
- 🌱 How to interview well ... this seems to be something that you never master ... like Texas Hold'em
- 💞️ I'll help out where I can.
- 📫 You should reach me through issues and pull requests, but if you need to, you can get a message to me at shiny.gift6738@fastmail.com
